_We're currently looking to grow our team in Boulder, Colorado and Raleigh, North Carolina. Interested? Keep reading or [skip to Open Positions](#open-positions). :)_

## Who Are We?

At Waffle.io, we're reinventing the way engineering teams track work. We believe developers shouldn't have to do extra work to update others on their status, so Waffle does it for them.

Waffle.io is an Enterprise Lean Startup, running inside one of the largest independent software corporations in the world, CA Technologies. We believe in rapidly iterating on solutions with our customers, to find problems that are worth solving.

Are you passionate about improving the lives of developers like yourself? Do you thrive in a startup environment, where it’s up to you to solve a wide range of technical problems and work across the stack? If so, we’d love to meet you!

## Who Are You?

We’re looking for **craftswomen and craftsmen** who are **curious**, **creative**, **humble**, and are **empathetic**.

### Craftsmanship

We take pride in what we build. We focus on delivering the right thing to our customers, and we care deeply about quality. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you value writing tests, love seeing your work go to production with continuous deployments, and strive to make everything you touch just a little bit better when you leave it.

### Curiosity and Creativity

We are disciplined explorers, learning from our customers and trying new things to discover the future of the way engineering teams track work. We believe in the art of the possible. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you like saying [“yes, and”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Yes,_And%22_rule) to new ideas, but can also focus on what needs to get done.

### Humility

We value having a shared vision and coming together as a team to pursue it together. We each bring unique ideas to the table, and we’re excited when we’re able to work together to turn our ideas into something that’s better. You’ll fit in well if you can put aside your own awesomeness to make the team you work with stronger than any one individual.

### Empathy

We’re building a product that we ourselves use every day, and we know we need help from our customers to build the right thing. We value working with and understanding our customers. You’ll be a good fit on our team if you’re excited to meet Waffle’s customers and you’ll go above and beyond to make their day better.

## What’s It Like Working on Waffle.io?

### The Team

We’re a distributed team, with teammates in Boulder, CO and Raleigh, NC.

We run as a startup inside a big company. That means we do our own sales, marketing, devops, and of course product, development, and support. Each of us wears many hats.

### The Tech

Waffle.io runs on a NodeJS, AngularJS, CoffeeScript, MongoDB, and Docker stack. We’re hosted using cloud services, but also ship behind the firewall. We have a microservice architecture that’s continuously deployed.

### The Process

We use our own product to manage our work. Anyone in the world can see what we’re up to here: https://waffle.io/waffleio/waffle.io.

## Open Positions

### Technical Support Engineer

We're looking for someone to help us serve our customers better, by answering their questions and diagnosing issues they come across. This is a very technical role, since our product is serving a technical audience. This role will grow into helping us support our on-premises product, [Waffle Takeout](https://takeout.waffle.io), which will involve understanding networking, docker, and server infrastructure. 

We're a small team with a huge mission; there are many roles for you to grow into or create.

#### More about the role
As a technical support engineer, you will interact with customers via our in-app messaging platform, Intercom.io, our public GitHub repository where customers report issues and feature requests  ([http://waffle.io/waffleio/waffle.io](http://waffle.io/waffleio/waffle.io)), and Twitter (@waffleio) to assist with technical questions and issue reports. We’re looking for someone who learns quickly, communicates clearly, and wants to give customers the best experience possible.

*Key Responsibilities:*
- Act as first line of defense for customer questions, feedback, and bug reports through all customer communication channels
- Provide customers with excellent customer service including relaying best practices, diagnosing bugs, and continually keeping customers updated on the status of their requests
- Assist with creating and updating technical documentation for new and existing features
- Track and relay customer feedback and bug reports to the rest of the team 
- Perform testing of features & site functions, escalate issues, and communicate issues to the team
- When possible, jump in the code to fix issues or pair with a dev to fix them. Handling the support queue won't take all your time, and we want to enable you to grow into other roles on the team.
